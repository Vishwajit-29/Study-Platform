// Gamification logic is now handled entirely by the backend.
// This file is kept as a placeholder. All gamification state
// is fetched from the /api/gamification endpoint via GamificationContext.
//
// Level thresholds and XP reward constants are defined in ../types/index.ts
// and on the backend in GamificationService.java.
